Thanks for downloading iGreedy, a tool able to detect, enumerate and 
geolocate anycast replicas with a fistful of pings [1]. This brief readme
file describes the basic steps to get started with the tool. The tool
allows to  (i) analyze existing measurement or (ii) generate and analyze
new measurement (iii) visualize the measurement on a GoogleMap [2]. 
The package also contains (iv) datasets corredated  with ground-truth to 
assess the accuracy of the tool. A technical report detailing the iGreedy 
technique and dataset is available at:
